                            <p>Nick Nunez, founder and sole proprietor of N Squared Tutorials, LLC, is a Florida native
                                and current resident in Maitland, Florida. He attended University of Miami for one year
                                and spent his remaining college years in Florida International University, where he
                                graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor
                                of Science in Applied Mathematics. Nick has been assisting others with mathematics since
                                high school in 2013, when he was not only a tutor for his school’s Mu Alpha Theta
                                mathematics honor society but also a member of the school’s calculus team and the coach
                                for the calculus division. He tutored on the side for the next several years while
                                attending university and working full-time until he realized that he could work
                                full-time doing the very thing that he always loved.</p>

                            <p>Nick founded N Squared Tutorials, named after his initials, NN, in 2022. He tutors
                                mathematics of all levels from sixth grade to undergraduate studies. He also helps
                                students prepare for all sections of the SAT, on which he scored at the 99th percentile.
                                His tutoring aims to present mathematical concepts to students from multiple angles and
                                to follow a goal- and logic-oriented approach to solving problems rather than a
                                formula-oriented one. This would greatly reduce the cognitive load that students
                                normally bear from the learning process while simultaneously emphasizing and, therefore,
                                honing soft skills such as abstraction, pattern recognition, critical thinking, and
                                others that are applied in a multitude of areas besides mathematics. Strong emphasis is
                                also placed on improving mental math skills, for there is a strong correlation between
                                mental computation and mathematical reasoning.</p>

                            <p>While Nick is certainly passionate about helping others excel in their mathematical and
                                SAT-adjacent endeavors, he also has his fair share of additional hobbies. Nick is an
                                avid gamer, some of his favorite games being fantasy JRPGs, fighters, and survival
                                horror. He also has an expansive taste in music, bedroom pop and dream pop being his
                                biggest go-tos. He has been singing since high school, in which he was in a choir, an
                                extracurricular activity he participated in even throughout his years in university. In
                                both University of Miami and Florida International University, Nick participated in the
                                music schools’ audition-based advanced choirs, in both of which he was a tenor and the
                                only non-music major. In the former, he was a member of a cappella group UMiami Tufaan
                                and even performed in the university’s production of 13: The Musical. Even today, he
                                enjoys producing his own music on FL Studio, his DAW of choice.</p>

                            <p>Nick is also a member of Mensa, the largest and oldest high-IQ society in the world, open
                                to those who score at least at the 98th percentile internationally on an approved IQ
                                test. He enjoys the occasional meetups with other Mensans in the Central Florida region,
                                whether it be a picnic at the park or some Italian food with fellow members.</p>

                            <p>Nick currently lives in Maitland, FL, which is basically Orlando, FL to those who aren’t
                                familiar with the area and are more familiar with Walt Disney World and Universal
                                Orlando Resort (for both of which he is an annual passholder, of course!). He conducts
                                tutoring sessions exclusively via Zoom, for which a permanent link will be provided.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li class="why-list">I studied Applied Mathematics and Computer Science in university.
                                    While it is obvious as to why the former is relevant, students of the latter sharpen
                                    the same soft skills as in the former–more specifically, the computer science
                                    graduate’s ability to design a solution for a coding problem requires abstraction,
                                    critical thinking, and problem solving that would be required in solving everyday
                                    math problems. This additional perspective allows me to more easily articulate ideas
                                    to my students in a visual, easy-to-understand manner.</li>
                                <li class="why-list">Your student is guaranteed to have me as your tutor. No surprises.
                                    Most companies have a team of tutors, and many times, the tutor will be assigned to
                                    you. There may be times when your tutor will no longer be able to help you, and you
                                    will be assigned to someone else. This may prevent the opportunity for your student
                                    to get comfortable and establish full rapport with a tutor. You may also have a
                                    tutor that the company did not advertise as much.</li>
                                <li class="why-list">This is my profession. This is another one that may leave you
                                    asking yourself So what? The answer to that is that many tutors can’t say the same.
                                    If you send your student to another tutoring company, chances are very high that you
                                    will have a tutor who only works part-time at the center. Another fact is that these
                                    tutors only make a fraction of what you are paying for. Considering the low pay and
                                    the lack of full-time opportunities, these tutors are usually college students
                                    lacking degrees, sometimes pursuing irrelevant majors, and having minimal experience
                                    in a field in which they do not grow at the same rate as someone who works
                                    full-time. There is also no guarantee that you will stick with the same tutor
                                    throughout your time working with the company considering turnover for several
                                    reasons including the pay and graduation from college. I work as a tutor full-time,
                                    so you are guaranteed quality service.</li>
                                <li class="why-list">You pay as you go. You will not be required to pay for multiple
                                    sessions ahead of time, and the reason I bring this up is that for most tutoring
                                    companies, you are required to sign a contract and pay for a nonrefundable package.
                                </li>
                                <li class="why-list">I do everything in my power to ensure your student's success. There
                                    is a reason I entrust my clients with my personal number. If your student ever needs
                                    further clarification on something covered in a lesson, they are always free to
                                    contact me between sessions at no extra charge. More than anything, I want to make
                                    sure that my students understand the material 100% of the time, but I do understand
                                    that sessions have time limits, and I will do anything in my power to help in any
                                    way I can. I mean it. If you are a parent, the same applies. You are free to contact
                                    me for any reason between sessions. Parents are my biggest teammates here. I want
                                    what is best for your child, so I strongly encourage communication to ensure the
                                    most fruitful experience for them.</li>
                                <li class="why-list">I am adaptable to my students. I tailor every session to your
                                    student’s needs. Once I get to know the student in the first session, I have an idea
                                    of what may work and what may not.</li>
                                <li class="why-list">I am personable. There is a reason software engineering wasn’t for
                                    me. I am a bit on the extroverted side, and I learned this when comparing my
                                    experience as a software engineering intern to my experience as a tutor and camp
                                    counselor/director for Miami Dade County Parks and Recreation. I love to talk. A
                                    lot. I genuinely love getting to know people, and I love to laugh, which I do a lot.
                                    Yes, I even laugh at math. I also have a wide variety of interests, so chances are
                                    very high that I will find something that will get me and your student to click.
                                </li>
                                <li class="why-list">I will work with the student from the ground up if necessary. It
                                    doesn’t matter to me whether you are in sixth grade or almost done with your
                                    bachelor’s degree. At the end of the day, mathematical reasoning depends on a strong
                                    foundation, much like a building. Without that foundation, there is no way that one
                                    can truly grasp a new mathematical concept. None. You may fool yourself into
                                    thinking that you know by knowing the formulas to plug in and such, but there is no
                                    way to deeply understand without a solid foundation. I will make sure to assess the
                                    student’s foundational knowledge and bridge any existing gaps (with the student’s
                                    effort, of course) to ensure a safer, more confident journey into newer concepts.
